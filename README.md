The contact with the outside world is important for young children. Previous researches related to children cognition show that the understanding of abstract concepts develops from the interaction with the physical objects. Getting children to interact with the physical world,resulting in relevant augmented digital information appearing and which can subsequently be interacted with,is what can facilitate active learning. This made us think about creating a new kind of interface which can offer children more access to tangible interface in this virtual era. In this paper, we design a new way of interaction--to play beyond the screen. We combine the paper and touchscreen devices into one interface to create a new experience, in which the content and interaction are both not restricted in the screen, thus bringing children a multi-sensory and stereo interaction system.
